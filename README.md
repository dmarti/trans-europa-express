# trans-europa-express

Bonjour!

This is a browser extension to find and run the
JavaScript that sites use to detect whether or not
you're European, so that you get better privacy
by default.

**Step 1:** Find web sites that have special JavaScript that gives Europeans extra privacy rights because #GDPR.

**Step 2:** Run a little extra JavaScript on the page, to set off the European detector.

**Step 3:** Enjoy virtual European status. Alles in Ordnung.

## Why?

So that you can get de-creepified Europe-ready
web ads from anywhere.  More info:
